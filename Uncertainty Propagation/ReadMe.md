# Moment-Based Exact Uncertainty Propagation #

We use higher order moments to represent Non-Gaussian probability distributions.

**Time Evolution of The Moments**

We use mixed-trigonometric-polynomial moments to obtain a deterministic system that describes the exact time evolution of the moments of the states of the stochastic nonlinear system.
